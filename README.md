# Support My Work
If you've found any of my open-source projects helpful, I'd be delighted if you considered expressing your gratitude by making a donation. Your support not only fuels my passion for coding but also helps sustain my journey as a student and developer.  
I currently accept donations from the following services:
- [Ko-Fi](https://ko-fi.com/seriaati): Most preferred because 0% fee, supports PayPal only.
- [BuyMeACoffee](https://buymeacoffee.com/seria): 5% fee but supports much more payment methods.
- [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/seriaati): It just works I guess, also 10% fee :(
