# About me
👋 Hi, I'm an international student, currently studying CS in Waseda Uni.  
🌍 I speak Chinese and English.  
🐍 My most used and most loved programming languages is Python, and I use it to code things like:  

## Discord bots
🦢 [Shenhe](https://github.com/seriaati/shenhe_bot): My largest and most sucessful project so far (discontinued).  
🚧 [Hoyo Buddy](https://github.com/seriaati/hoyo-buddy): The rewrite of Shenhe that is in-progress.  
💙 [Layla](https://github.com/seriaati/layla): A small bot with anime image searching features derived from Shenhe.  
📅 [Schedule Bot](https://github.com/seriaati/ScheduleBot): A collab project with other people.
🛝 [Sugari](https://github.com/Sugari-Bot): A multi-purpose Discord bot that I contributed a small part of.

## API wrappers
🔥 [ambr.py](https://github.com/seriaati/ambr): Async API wrapper for [ambr.top](https://ambr.top/)  
🌸 [yatta.py](https://github.com/seriaati/yatta): Async API wrapper for [hsr.yatta.top](https://hsr.yatta.top/)  
🟢 [line.py](https://github.com/seriaati/line.py): Async LINE messaging API wrapper based on [line-bot-sdk](https://github.com/line/line-bot-sdk-python) for me to code the LINE bots.  
💵 [ecpay.py](https://github.com/seriaati/ecpay.py): Technically not an API wrapper, it just contains some stuff I figured out with ecpay (it's quite complicated).  
😳 [hmtai](https://github.com/seriaati/hmtai_async): Async API wrapper for hmtai (discontinued).  

## Web apps (with [Flet](https://github.com/flet-dev/flet))
➡️ [Enka to GO](https://github.com/seriaati/enka-to-go): A website that converts your showcase on [Enka](https://enka.network/) to [Genshin Optimizer](https://frzyc.github.io/genshin-optimizer/#/) for damage calculations.  
🧑‍🤝‍🧑 [Tuan Tuan](https://github.com/chatmind-studio/tuan-tuan): A web app + LINE bot combo that assists tasks related to group buying.  

## LINE bots
💬 [ChatMind Studio](https://github.com/chatmind-studio): A two-people studio (just me and my dad, although he didn't contribute a single line of code 😂), you can find all of my LINE bots here, some of them are private repos because I use them to make some money.  

## Honorable mentions
🌙 [Hoyolab Resin Counter](https://github.com/seriaati/hoyolab-resin-counter): My first project on GitHub with Python, this is where everything started.
